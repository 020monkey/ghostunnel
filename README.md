Ghostunnel is a simple SSL/TLS proxy with mutual authentication support for
securing non-TLS backend applications. Ghostunnel in server mode runs in front
of a backend service and accepts TLS-secured connections, which are then proxied
to the (insecure) backend. A backend can be a TCP domain/port or a UNIX socket path.

Ghostunnel in client mode accepts (insecure) TCP or UNIX socket connections and
proxies them to a TLS-secured service.

In other words, ghostunnel is a replacement for stunnel.

See ghostunnel --help, ghostunnel server --help and ghostunnel client --help.

Features
========

***Authentication/access control***: Ghostunnel enforces mutual authentication
by always requiring a valid client certificate. We also support access control
via checks of the CN/OU fields on the subject of a client certificate. This is
useful for restricting access to services that don't have native access control.

***Certificate hotswapping***: Ghostunnel can reload certificates at runtime
without dropping existing connections. To trigger a reload, simply send
`SIGUSR1` to the process. This will cause ghostunnel to reload the keystore
files and open a new listening socket (via `SO_REUSEPORT`). Once successful,
the old listening socket will be closed.

***Automatic reloading***: Ghostunnel can be configured to automatically reload
certificates. You can specify an interval with the `--timed-reload` flag. If
the timed reload flag is enabled, ghostunnel will reload the files periodically
and check for changes. If a change is detected, it will attempt to reload the
listener with the new certificates/private key.

***Emphasis on security***: We have put some thought into making ghostunnel secure
by default. In server mode, the target connection must live on localhost or
a UNIX socket (unless --unsafe-target is specified). In a similar way, in client
mode the listening socket must live on localhost or a UNIX socket (unless --unsafe-listen
is specified). Ghostunnel negotiates TLS 1.1 (by default) and a small set of ciphers.


Getting started
===============

To get started and play around with the implementation, you will need to
generate some test certificates. If you want to bootstrap a full PKI, one
good way to get started is to use a package like
[square/certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap). If you only need
some test certificates for playing around with the tunnel, you can find
some pre-generated ones in the `test-keys` directory (alongside instructions
on how to generate new ones with OpenSSL).

### Build

We use [glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide) for vendoring.
Use `go get github.com/Masterminds/glide` or `brew install glide` to install it.

Then, build ghostunnel and run tests:

    make build
    make test

If you want to update vendored dependencies:

    make update-depends

Ghostunnel is tested with Go 1.6, and our integration test suite requires
Python 3.5 with pyOpenSSL installed.

### Launch (in server mode)

This is a short example for how to launch ghostunnel listening for incoming
TLS connections on `localhost:8443` and forwarding them to `localhost:8080`. We
assume that `server.p12` is a PKCS12 keystore with the certificate and private
key for the server, and that `root.crt` contains your trusted root certificate(s).

This example has been tested with OpenSSL 1.0.1.

To set allowed clients, you must specify at least one of `--allow-all`,
`--allow-cn`, `--allow-ou`, `--allow-dns-san`, or `--allow-ip-san`. It's
possible to use these together or to specify them repeatedly to allow multiple
clients. In this example, we assume that the CN of the client cert we want to
accept connections from is `client`.

Start netcat on port 8080:

    nc -l 127.0.0.1 8080

Start a ghostunnel with a server certificate:

    ghostunnel server \
        --listen 127.0.0.1:8443 \
        --target 127.0.0.1:8080 \
        --keystore test-keys/server.p12 \
        --cacert test-keys/root.crt \
        --allow-cn client

Verify that the client(s) can connect with their client certificate:

    openssl s_client \
        -connect 127.0.0.1:8443 \
        -cert test-keys/client.crt \
        -key test-keys/client.key \
        -CAfile test-keys/root.crt

If `openssl s_client` can connect, then the tunnel should be working as
intended! Be sure to check the logs to see incoming connections and other
information. Note that by default ghostunnel logs to stderr and runs in the
foreground (set `--syslog` to log to syslog). For deamonization, we recommend
using a utility such as [daemonize](http://software.clapper.org/daemonize/).
For an example on how to use ghostunnel in a Docker container, see the `docker`
subdirectory.

### Launch (in client mode)

In client mode, we want ghostunnel to listen for incoming TCP connections
and forward them to a TLS server.

Start a TLS server:

    openssl s_server \
        -accept 8443 \
        -cert test-keys/server.crt \
        -key test-keys/server.key \
        -CAfile test-keys/root.crt

Start a ghostunnel with a client certificate. The client certificate is also
used to serve the `/_status` endpoint (when enabled):

    ghostunnel client \
        --listen 127.0.0.1:8080 \
        --target 127.0.0.1:8443 \
        --keystore test-keys/client.p12 \
        --cacert test-keys/root.crt

Verify that we can connect to `8080`:

    nc -v 127.0.0.1 8080

### Two ghostunnels which talk to each other

We can combine the above two examples. Notice how you can start the ghostunnels
in either order.

Start netcat on port 8001:

    nc -l 127.0.0.1 8001

Start the first ghostunnel:

    ghostunnel server \
        --listen 127.0.0.1:8002 \
        --target 127.0.0.1:8001 \
        --keystore test-keys/server.p12 \
        --cacert test-keys/root.crt \
        --allow-cn client

Start the second ghostunnel:

    ghostunnel client \
        --listen 127.0.0.1:8003 \
        --target 127.0.0.1:8002 \
        --keystore test-keys/client.p12 \
        --cacert test-keys/root.crt

Verify that we can connect to `8003`:

    nc -v 127.0.0.1 8003
